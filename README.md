# Data-Analysis-with-Python
This Repository for IBM: DA0101EN Data Analysis with Python Course, will be includes all notebooks used
Welcome to Data Science with Python. In this course, you will go over everything from how to load data to building basic machine learning models. Each level in the pyramid summarises concepts you will learn in each module. The outer labels give a general summary. As you can see, this course will start you off with the basics, the libraries you need and how to work with data. You will learn how to analyze data using summary statistics; this section is useful if you would like to make an argument with data. Finally, you will learn how to build Machine Learning Models and see how these models work in the real world.
